# Material UI with NextJS

After following the bellow reference, I couldn't write the following import: `'use client'; import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';`. I think you just need the standard MUI.

```bash
# Not sure about this. I think its best to just use MUI as usual!!!
npm install --save @mui/material-nextjs @emotion/cache

# Business as usual:
npm install --save @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material

npm install --save-dev @types/react
```
